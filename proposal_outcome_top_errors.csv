A significant issue raised repeatedly by many members concerns the time and effort required to apply Market Updates. Currently, approximately 70-90% of the proposals pertain solely to updating market parameters. Gauntlet uses analytics and algorithms to determine new parameters based on current market conditions. These proposals are highly specific and require unique skills for validation. So far, we have seen minimal participation from other community members or teams in validating these parameters. Assuming the total cost of reviewing a proposal (including the effort of all delegates) is $2,000 per proposal, we are spending upwards of $300,000 per year on a process that currently acts more as a friction layer without much safeguard, as these market update proposals are rarely reviewed thoroughly. This not only slows down the process but also diverts focus from reviewing essential proposals related to new partnerships, the addition of new chains, and the introduction of assets, etc. We propose a parallel process specifically for market updates that can bypass the normal governance lifecycle. This would enable us, as a Compound community, to move faster and concentrate on the most critical decisions. This proposal has already been discussed here - https://www.comp.xyz/t/market-updates-alternate-governance-track/5379 The forum post includes two solutions, and OpenZeppelin has provided details and feedback on those solutions. After discussing with OpenZeppelin, DoDAO and OZ together believe that given the amount of changes, updating the Configurator could be the best solution. OpenZeppelin mentioned a couple of important points in the forum post: 1. Grant the market admin role to an Safe address, which can be maintained by Gauntlet or other community members. 2. Market Updates to the Configurator will go through a timelock, providing sufficient time for the community to review or even block the market updates via this alternate route. https://tally.xyz/gov/compound/proposal/408",False

The strategy has three parts: * **COMP Yield Strategy**: Use COMP to generate USDC yield. This strategy maintains COMP exposure whilst making opportunistic sales possible at higher prices. In the meantime, it targets to deliver 15% or more annualised net USDC-denominated yield on COMP tokens. * **Deposit USDC into Compound for cUSDC**: Deploy USDC proceeds from the COMP strategy into Compound lending markets, earning additional yield via Compound-deposited cTokens. * **cUSDC & Yield-Generating Buybacks**: Use yield-generating cUSDC as the underlying for put options to earn yield on yield while buying back COMP at favourable key levels. As each COMP -> cUSDC -> COMP cycle completes, **the strategy can be continuously rolled over to keep generating yield for the DAO**. ## Outcomes: * Earn USDC-denominated yield on COMP (targeting 15% APY). * Earn yield on cUSDC proceeds deposited into Compound. * Earn yield on yield while buying back COMP at key levels. * Enhance capital efficiency and financial sustainability. * Stimulate trading volume and market liquidity. ## Ask: * 34k COMP (≈$1.5m as of March 25th) to execute on the outlined strategy. # Proposal This proposal presents a treasury strategy to complement Gauntlet’s reserve management, with the aim of improving capital efficiency and revenue on idle treasury assets to support the DAO’s capacity to fund growth initiatives and improve financial sustainability. The proposed overall strategy includes three parts: ## 1. COMP Yield Strategy We propose using COMP to write out-of-the-money call options that balance maximum upfront premium while keeping conversion probability reasonably low. Since the most recent feedback-based adjustments to the proposal means less focus on depositing USDC into a yield-generating vault and more so on rolling an “options wheel”, we will also adjust the strategy parameters to lower the conversion probability. * Target an average 15% annualized option premium, +/-5% in the short term following the lowered conversion probability target. * Expiry for covered calls will not exceed 180 days. * If no suitable covered call opportunities meet these parameters, suboptimal trades will not be forced until the right opportunities arise. **See recent quotes:** ![compquote.png](ipfs://bafkreiaqqubfvdkl6477oxukrndoiuynligpay55twqtmgt3k6wxzh4dvi) ## 2. Deploy Stablecoin Proceeds into Compound Lending Markets All USDC proceeds from the option premiums and any COMP conversions will be deposited into Compound lending markets, earning additional yield via Compound-deposited stablecoin cTokens. ## 3. cUSDC Yield and Strategic Buybacks Building on feedback from different delegates, we propose using any converted stablecoins from the COMP Yield Strategy to strategically defend the COMP price at key levels through cash-secured puts using Compound-deposited, yield-generating cUSDC, as deemed appropriate pending market conditions. A cash-secured put strategy involves holding stablecoins while selling a put option on an underlying token (e.g., COMP), think a reverse covered call. Treasuries looking to conduct buybacks can use cash-secured puts at target price levels, committing to repurchasing tokens at a discounted price while earning option premiums along the way. In other words, if a conversion from the covered call strategy occurs—say, for example, $1 million worth of COMP is sold at a 130% strike price for $1.3 million USDC—we deposit the USDC into Compound. If the COMP price needs to be defended (see the ‘Buyback Triggers’ section below), we use the yield-bearing Compound USDC as collateral to write cash-secured puts. This allows us to earn additional **yield on yield** while converting USDC back into COMP if the price falls below the put strike levels, thereby defending and acquiring COMP at favorable prices—eliminating any potential strategic overlap related to USDC accumulation. **The bought-back COMP can then be used to rerun the covered call strategy, continuing the yield generation cycle for the Compound DAO**. We propose continuously monitoring market conditions using technical indicators (summarised below). If an attractive buyback opportunity is identified, the cTokens will be used as collateral to sell put options on COMP with: * Strike prices between 80-100% of the spot price. * Expiries of up to 90 days to optimize for stablecoin liquidity. ### Buyback Triggers Incorporating community feedback, we propose monitoring key indicators to objectively identify buyback opportunities: * **RSI-Based Trigger**: If RSI (14-day) drops below 30, COMP is considered oversold, signaling a potential buyback opportunity. * **Moving Average Crossover (SMA-14 & SMA-50)**: A buyback signal is confirmed when SMA-14 crosses above SMA-50 after a downtrend. * **MACD Confirmation**: If MACD crosses above its signal line, this reconfirms positive momentum and a potential buyback opportunity. * **Market & Earnings Multiples**: Additional fundamental market dynamics and earnings multiples can be incorporated to refine buyback execution. Below is an illustration of historical buyback signals based on these indicators: # Implementation and Execution While the infrastructure setup of the proposed strategy will be fully detailed in a follow up on-chain proposal, this section outlines the implementation from a high level below. Avantgarde have typically used a combination of Safe multisig roles & permissions (via the Zodiac Roles Modifier) for implementing bespoke treasury management strategies. These setups provide beneficial flexibility to fine-tune execution of the strategy, while still protecting the DAOs assets by setting permissions so that only specific pre-agreed actions on selected protocols can be performed. We propose to keep the assets to be managed in a Safe multisig (referred to as the Avatar safe) owned by the Compound Governor contract, and add a separate 1-out-of-2 multisig (the Signer safe) managed by Avantgarde and Myso as a signer on the Avatar safe execute transactions. ![Avatar safe-3.png](ipfs://bafkreig4ydzkhqm5ed3mxuofh4ml5ww7hovfhhg2v3phx57w444qgq363m) To facilitate efficient trading operations, we will use the Zodiac Roles Modifier with granular permissions that would allow the Signer safe to *only* perform these operations: * Depositing in the USDC and COMP compound markets * Taking quotes and withdrawing proceeds from MYSO V3 (“takeQuote” and “withdraw” actions on the MysoV3Router contract) ## Strategy Execution Execution of the options strategy will be done through MYSO v3, which eliminates the need for institutional trading firms to take custody of COMP tokens or rely on off-chain legal agreements. **The entire process is decentralized, secure, and transparent, ensuring maximum returns while retaining full asset control.** ### MYSO Protocol Architecture The protocol consists of two core smart contracts: the Router and the Escrow Implementation Contract. These contracts are publicly available in the official MYSO V3 repository and have been thoroughly [audited by Omniscia](https://omniscia.io/reports/myso-finance-call-option-system-v3-6737e49a92361c0018163789/).

(Resubmission) Should the following Tier 4: up to $60,000 USD, 6 months vesting (1 month cliff) grant in the Platform Contributor category be approved? ## Abstract At MetaPlay, we are creating one of the first intelligent & independent virtual companions. This was made possible by embedding an innovative state-of-the-art AI code into our first chicken NFTs. The CryptoChicken plays and interacts with the owner and its environment, bridging the gap of static pets with limited functionality in the Metaverse. Our team currently has a small staff of talented individuals with a variety of significant capabilities. Each member comes from multiple types of professional formations such as finance, web development, and business studies, besides having worked with multiple noteworthy businesses. Our vision is to empower Decentraland's community with smart and interactive pets that have yet to tread on this land. ## Grant size 60,000 USD ## Beneficiary address 0x01F0b8e92F0ca0398482C265a99612196c8782fE ## Description Hello fellow Decentralanders! We are MetaPlay®, a newly founded NFT development company with the desire to innovate and expand the horizons of Decentraland and the metaverse as a whole. Our first NFT project is called TheCryptoChickenCollective. (For a sample, go check out the info on specifications below!) With this project, we are fulfilling a major desire for Decentraland's user base, which is the need for having a companion animal that follows you around. Our chickens are not just animated pets, but also interactive and smart, allowing for a brand new experience for Decentraland’s Community! TheCryptoChickenCollective was founded in December of 2021 with the intent of creating one of Decentraland's first pets that moves independent of the users avatar motions. In addition to moving independently of the character the chickens will develop their own personality over time based on how the user cares for and interacts with their chicken, and this in turn will affect its overall statistics. As our project progresses, we intend on adding a battle feature to our project that will allow users to battle their chickens against one another right in Decentraland! Side note: It is worth mentioning that the development of this proprietary code has lead to further developments, which we believe could make animated wearables (ie. wings the user can wear that actually flap) a real possibility in the near future ""winky face"". We believe in Decentraland and our project so much that we have spent countless hours and a significant amount of resources out of pocket already on the development of this project, which we hope will bring joy to all the users of DCL. While we have many more ideas as well as the technical ability to back them, we don't have the funding to continue our conquest. Although we have already managed to break a few boundaries in the platform, we believe we still need to increase our limited staff members in order to keep on delivering our promising roadmap! Upon all the amazing feedback we received on our last proposal we have made significant changes to the funding request for our project. Originally our project asked for 240k for development which we believe could greatly benefit not only this project but Decentraland as a whole by way of the technological advances our project proves to bring in the near future. With that said, we fully understand and acknowledge the concerns some had regarding our lack of history in DCL and giving such a large grant to a brand new project. For this reason we have elected to reduce our original asking amount by 75%. With this new grant we strongly believe we can develop this project into one which we calculate could bring up to 1000+ new Daily Active Users to DCL. The 60k will spend as follows over a 6 month period. 20k backend development = 3,3k/month 10K graphics + animation = 1.6k/month 5k web development = 800$/month 15k marketing = 2.5k/month 5k Discord maintenance = 900$/month 5k Miscellaneous development expenses = 900$/month ## Specification Our developer and designer are world class professionals with over 30 years of experience in their respective industries. Our designer has done animation and graphics for a variety of television, film and corporate projects and our developer has played a key role in the development of software for NASA, Unity, and Lightwave 3D. Due to the proprietary nature of the coding we are unable to disclose the exact manner in which we achieved the animated companions but we hope that our current example on our Land (22,89) will prove to be enough evidence that we know what we are doing and can deliver everything promised in a timely manner. Basically we created a cool looking chicken that, while in the beta testing phase, anyone can try out and enjoy within our C.C.C. partnered LAND and the project's upcoming partners. To check out what all the hype is about please visit our land at: ChickenLand (22,89) (link provided below) (INSTRUCTIONS: Click the red box on the corner, wait for it to turn green, then go to the middle statue and click ""summon your chicken"". Disclaimer: we have yet to add additional AI functionalities and coloring to the chicken, but will do so immediately following our first drop. The first drop will be a wearable in the form of a gold chain that enables your pet chicken to show up behind you once equipped on your avatar.)

Those contributions include some of the largest weekly gatherings in DCL, serving as an entry point for many metaverse music fans, and writing the blueprint for dozens of artists and DJs to follow. A grant from the Decentraland DAO will help StoneyEye develop greater opportunities in the art and music spaces of DCL, while also bringing additional web2 producers and musicians into Decentraland. These efforts will be conducted with the goal of increasing new users in DCL and improving user retention. ## Grant size 60,000 USD in DAI ## Project duration 6 months ## Beneficiary address 0x082f2A8ea1D8E3ee24c20d12452B7E851ad0D5DD ## Email address sespromusic@gmail.com ## Description Stoney’s ability to engage with DCL audiences results in an environment that has become synonymous with Decentraland performances–quality music combined with social engagement, both in-world and on social platforms. The rapid growth of music communities in DCL can be traced from his first residency at Parcel Party, which became a must-attend weekly event for many users. Beginning in November, 2021, a Stoney event has been on the calendar nearly every week, including the addition of MoFyah Mondays at the TRU Band Room and MoBeatz every-other Sunday. During a period with decreased attendance across much of Decentraland, Stoney has continued to generate good-sized audiences, which benefits other DCL projects and creators by creating a reliable, consistent pathway into DCL for new users. Prior to his time in Decentraland, Stoney began his career as a successful recording/touring musician and producer, sharing the stage with numerous A-list acts. His experience in the greater world of music provides an invaluable education for independent musicians entering web3. The melding of art, music, social content, and community engagement is what creates the unique environment of DCL music. In addition to presenting his own music, Stoney has collaborated with several other musicians and DJs in the space, furthering the strength of bond in metaverse music. As brands and investors look to Decentraland as a viable platform for messaging and events, the community fostered by DCL musicians becomes even more important by providing consistent engagement opportunities. In addition to music, Stoney also contributes to visual arts and design in Decentraland. He is a prolific artist and wearable creator, who consistently contributes forward-thinking designs to help highlight DCL. His hand-drawn art has appeared on dozens of event attendance tokens, increasing the value proposition of attending his shows. Late last year, Stoney began MoBeatz, an interactive event, during which a piece of music is created live. In collaboration with DCL community members, these “beats” are minted and airdropped to all attendees. This innovative approach to user engagement provides an opportunity to engage with prominent music producers, which again provides a compelling reason for new users to enter Decentraland. Funding from the Decentraland DAO will help establish the framework for artist self-sufficiency in the metaverse. In addition to upgrading equipment, building a long-term social engagement events strategy, this grant will build on the existing mentorship opportunities already provided by Stoney. This education will bring more musicians, artists, and producers to DCL, increasing attendance and showcasing the strength of community. https://twitter.com/RoadRunner778/status/1658561199846600704 TRU Band Room- Mo Fyah Monday https://twitter.com/fermion_dcl_eth/status/1516926795945283584 Parcel Party- Magic Hour https://twitter.com/RoadRunner778/status/1622575622852866049 Mo Beatz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THV0hTqTcRg Metazoo Note- This proposal is for one year's worth of work in 6 months of payment ## Roadmap and milestones Scheduled Events: August 2023: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios September 2023: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios October 2023: 5 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios November 2023: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios December 2023: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios January 2024: 5 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios February 2024: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios March 2024: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 3 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios April 2024: 5 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios May 2024: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios June 2024: 4 MoFyah events at TRU, and 3 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios July 2024: 5 MoFyah events at TRU, and 2 MoBeatz events at Stoney Eye Studios Every Monday at TRU Band Room for MoFyah.
